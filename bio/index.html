                            In the hopes of giving their daughter a better chance at a good education bea is sent to
                            live with her estranged grandmother at the beginning of middle school.
                            <br> <br>
                            <I>finders keepers</I> is a feature length film I wrote to practice storyboarding scenes.
                            The film deals with topics such as the correlation between poverty and poor education,
                            familial estrangement and reconciliation, gender identity issues, learning to become your
                            own person, self-care, and more.

                            2020
                            <br> <br>
                            this piece was inspired by a commission done as a virtual flyer for a party that included
                            using a flashing effect in a .gif to simulate lightening.
                            <br> <br>
                            it was done using photoshop on an ipad in a 3 hour period from start to finish.
                            <br> <br>
                            i think this piece shows some of my technical ability in character design, color layout, and
                            scene lighting. the linework is clean and the story is easy to read. proof of this is in the
                            fact that the character’s emotions are clear, they’re posed dynamically, each object drawn
                            is important to the narrative, the colors chosen are bold yet natural, and the lighting
                            informs the mood.

                            sharon tate is famous for films such as <I>valley of the dolls</I> and <I>don’t make
                                waves</I>, but might be better known for the way she was murdered by members on the
                            manson family in 1969. this etching reflects on the aesthetics of the end title card of
                            early hollywood cinema. It poses the question of whether sharon tate really met her end that
                            day, or if she may still live on in her films.

                            <I> music muses</I> is a self-published zine containing 12 digital illustrations of various
                            characters enjoying music. each character has a coresponding playlist with a track list that
                            are related to the aesthetic portrayed in the character’s clothes and emotions.
                            <br><br>
                            this project was a practice in taking moods from music and portraying them as characters
                            with stories that could be told in one image. each character is unique using color,
                            clothing, props, and posing to give a sense of what kind of music they could be listening
                            to.
                            <br><br>
                            the zine will sell at quimby’s from march-may 2023 and in my online shop until further
                            notice.

                            haphephobia is a fear of being touched. The severity of the phobia depends on the person.
                            this piece aims to portray my inner feelings during the period of my life in which I
                            attempted to overcome my own haphephobia after moving to a big city where personal space
                            didn’t seem to exist. The distortion of the hands is to remind the viewer that while trigged
                            someone might not be perceiving the world the same as everyone else.

                            found materials, yarn scraps, paper, fabric scraps, crochet. the weaving is approximately
                            24” x 30” (not including the yarn tails that hang from the bottom).

                            A frame weaving, like all other forms of weaving, depends on the use of the grid to create
                            images and shapes as you stack yarn horizontally. This piece was an attack on that grid by
                            creating my own grid inside the weaving space and proceeding to hide it in the dredge of
                            miscellaneous yarn trimmings used to create a muddy volume of color. The grid, now hidden
                            from the viewer, (while technically impressive) is overlooked and ignored in favor of the
                            wildness that sits atop it.

                            many grecian myths include the moirai, also known as the three fates. these are three
                            sisters who control time and death. they’re often portrayed as hidden from the world
                            malevolently balancing humanity’s mortality and this piece depicts them tempting the viewer
                            into their hidden territory, what lies beyond their door? what can be learned from looking
                            more intimately at a character that is so broadly stereotyped?

                            <h1>LIFE SIZE NUDES IN GRAPHITE</h1>
                            2022
                            <br><br>
                            two life size nude drawings in graphite on hot press paper roll displayed at the school of
                            the art institute of chicago. approx. 2’ x 7’ not including extra rolled paper
                            <br><br>
                            each model sat for a period of 1.5 hours for a total of roughly 3 hours spent on this
                            project. The ghostly treatment of the materials asks you to fill in spaces in the drawing.
                            Strategically omitting sections of the figures bodies and the scene force the time spent
                            observing each piece to be slowed down as the brain works. Our familiarity with the human
                            form make it so that less is needed to read the figure as a figure, so just how much of a
                            figure is necessary for us to recognize humanity?
